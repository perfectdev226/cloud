# February 2020 (v1.83)

Hi everyone! Welcome to the February 2020 release of SEO Studio. This release was primarily focused on improving the
admin panel, allowing you to embed tools on other websites, and customizing the studio to fit your brand. Here are the
highlights for this release:

- [New dashboard](#new-dashboard) – The admin dashboard received a much-needed overhaul.
- [Color editor](#color-editor) – Change the colors of elements on your website.
- [Tool embeds](#tool-embeds) – Embed individual tools onto other websites or blogs.
- [Improved saving](#improved-saving) – Applying changes in the admin panel is far less annoying.

## Admin

### New dashboard {#new-dashboard}

The admin dashboard has been redesigned to feature four different weekly spark performance graphs and a recent activity
log. More content will be added to the dashboard soon, and the design will likely continue to evolve. The release notes
have also been separated onto their own separate page.

### Color editor {#color-editor}

This new admin page allows you to customize various colors on the website in order to match the script to your brand.
This is currently experimental and only includes a selection of core colors – support for changing more colors, including
those used by extensions, will come soon. You can get started at [Customize &raquo; Colors](colors.php).

### Tool embeds {#tool-embeds}

You can now embed tools onto other websites using a small HTML snippet. For now, only admins can generate the embed
codes, but more options will come in the future. To create an embed, head over to [Tools &raquo; Embed tools](embed.php).

The following image shows an example of what it might look like on another website. You can also customize the colors
with the new [color customization](#color-customization) feature! More customization options coming soon. :)

### Outage indicator

The admin dashboard will display known outages. For example, if the data source used by a tool goes offline, then an
outage notice will be displayed until an update is released to fix it.

### Improved saving {#improved-saving}

On eligible pages and screen sizes, there is now a floating save button on the right side of the page. This button will
scroll with you and show whether you have unsaved changes. You'll also be warned if you try to leave the page without
saving first. See it in action at [Settings &raquo; Configuration](settings/general.php) – it will be on more pages soon!

### Stylesheet editor

The admin panel now includes a built-in custom stylesheet editor for overriding styles. This is only intended for
developers. Check it out at [Settings &raquo; Stylesheet](settings/stylesheet.php).

### Mail testing

A form was added to the [mail settings](settings/mail.php) page to send a test email. You can use this feature to
make sure mail is working properly and to debug errors.

### Timezone setting

You can now set the default system timezone. This is particularly useful for the new admin dashboard's spark graphs, but
may be used elsewhere in the future. Set your timezone at [Settings &raquo; Configuration](settings/general.php).

## Extensions

### Subscriptions

Until today, the behavior of the subscriptions extension was to redirect users to the pricing plans page when they tried to access
the tools list. Additionally, users who were subscribed to a plan would see all tools, even those they didn't have access to,
without any visual indicator that those tools were locked.

The subscriptions extension has now been changed to do the following:

- Guests can see the tools page. Clicking a tool will take them to pricing.
- Tools that subscribers can't access are grayed out. Clicking them goes to pricing.

## User experience

### New submit button when changing site

When users manually type in a new site, a submit button will appear for better user experience. You can still use the carriage return or enter keys
to apply the change. The button can also be recolored with the new color editor.
