## Admin panel {#admin-panel}

### New design {#admin-new-design}

With this update, several pages have been grouped together into a smaller number of sidebar items, instead using
horizontal tabs at the top of the page to navigate between related pages.

I hope this change will bring some relief to those who have had trouble navigating around the admin panel. More
pages will transition to the new design system soon!

### Responsive design {#admin-responsive-design}

The admin panel has been transitioned to Bootstrap 5. It's not quite finished yet, I have begun reworking older pages
to support small screens, and a mobile-friendly sidebar has been added.

## Content management {#content-management}

### Page editing {#page-editing}

You can now edit a selection of standard pages from one convenient dashboard. In addition, you can set custom titles,
descriptions, and other meta tags for these pages, as well as add custom content.

### Revamped tools page editor {#revamped-tools-page}

The internals of the tools page have been reworked to make it easier to manage categories, tool placement, and
translations. You can also now add descriptions to your tool categories ‚Äì these will show beneath the category names on
the tools list.

### New tool management {#tool-management}

There is a new dedicated page for managing tools. You can now disable tools and change their icons. You can also set
titles, meta tags, and custom content on each tool's landing page.

I've added 3 new icon sets to the script ‚Äì black, blue, and flat. You can choose between these sets easily when
managing tools. Have fun!

### Revamped advertising {#revamped-advertising}

The advertising system has been reworked from the ground up with additional slot sizes and more thoughtful placements.
You can now disable ads for specific user groups, and there's a new option that you can use to preview available
slots throughout the website.

### Auto translation for new languages {#auto-translate}

When creating a new language, there is now an option to automatically translate all of the script's text into the
language of choice. This is powered by Google Translate and may not be totally accurate, but it should help you get
up and running much quicker.

## Other new features {#other-features}

### Asset management {#assets}

You can now upload a favicon from the admin panel. Both the logo and favicon have been moved to a single page for
customizing branding assets. Also, you can increase the logo size now.

### Cookie-free browsing {#cookie-free}

The script uses cookies by default to track the current selected website when using tools. There is now an option to
disable this behavior and instead track the selected website using query parameters. It's not as reliable, but it's
there for those who need it.
